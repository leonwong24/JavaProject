# 2D Wave Survival Shooting Game
This is a Java project for IT Tralee semester 3 OOP module. By the end of the semester I hope to create a simple 2d java game, by watching youtube tutorial series from user CodeNMore: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dEKs-3GhVKQ&list=PLah6faXAgguMnTBs3JnEJY0shAc18XYQZ 

Although this project has been submitted for the Object Oriented Programming, the project still hasn't finished as I wanted to be.
The unfinished part of the project is wave design, character levelling and check point saving
